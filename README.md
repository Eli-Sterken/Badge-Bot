Welcome to the official Fern Bot GitHub repository!

FEATURES:

Fern Bot is a multi-purpose Discord Bot designed to make managing or owning a Discord server easier (AND REPLACE MEE6)!
It has features for moderation, automation, giveaways, games, server configuration, and more.
It also is free and open-source, so you know what you are getting down to every line of code.

Fern Bot has 0 ads, NFTs, or NSFW AI people (Unlike a different bot we know...)
it is all free, with no premium subscriptions, add Emails, none of it!

SETUP:

Fern Bot will have an official bot you can invite to your server soon, but if you want to make your own, or use it now, here is how you do it:
1. Download and run the installer [Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) and [Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Run the builder file in Main_Code(i.e. - Build.py)
3. Create a Discord bot client and enter its information as the file prompts you (You must know how to make a bot client, if you don't there are plenty of videos telling you how)
4. Invite the bot to your server and watch it work!

FILE STRUCTURE:

In the root directory, you will find the GitHub-related files as well as all sub-directories.
In the Midea folder, you will find all bot icons and Midea.
The Commands and Events folder contains all the command and event files organized into sub-directories.
The Main_Code folder contains the main file, the send commands file (which sends the commands to Discord,) and the Info.json file,
which contains the bot client information (token, ID, etc.)
There is also a builder.py file that builds and runs the bot.

NOTES:

1. This bot is still in the development phase, and may not work as expected, or at all.
2. There is currently no code in the repository, this is because I just created it and have not written the initial code yet.
   You can expect the initial code to be uploaded within a week.

HELP:

If you need any help at all, please feel free to Email me [Here](mailto:eli.stekren@outlook.com) 
You can also join the official testing Discord server [Here](https://discord.gg/k5xKgCrZ6f)

I hope you enjoy the bot, and thank you for stopping by!
