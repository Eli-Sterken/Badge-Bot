Welcome to the official Fern Bot GitHub repository!

FEATURES:

Fern Bot is a multi-purpose Discord Bot designed to make managing or owning a Discord server easier (AND REPLACE MEE6)!
It has features for moderation, automation, giveaways, games, server configuration, and more.
It also is free and open-source, so you know what you are getting down to every line of code.

Fern Bot has 0 ads, NFTs, or NSFW AI people (Unlike a different bot we know...)
it is all free, with no premium subscriptions, add Emails, none of it!

SETUP:

Fern Bot will have an official bot you can invite to your server soon, but if you want to make your own, or use it now, here is how you do it:
1. Download and run the installer [Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) and [Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Run the builder file in Main_Code(i.e. - Build.py)
3. Create a Discord bot client and enter its information as the file prompts you (You must know how to make a bot client, if you don't there are plenty of videos telling you how)
4. Invite the bot to your server and watch it work!

FILE STRUCTURE:

In the root directory, you will find all GitHub and NPM related files.
In the "Commands" and "Events" folders, all command and event files are stored, sorted in to sub-directorys.
In the "Main_Code" folder you will find the main code for the bot, as well as the builder program.
In the "Data" folder, there is all bot data (like tokens and defualt settings,) as well as a configuration file for each guild the bot is in. These configuration files are stored in the "Servers" sub-directory.
In the "Midea" folder you will find all the bot's icon and banner images.
In the "Utilaties" folder, you will find modules that are used throughout the bot's code.
In the "Web Server" folder, you will find the code for a small web server, whitch is used to get data from the bot's database.
